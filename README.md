# Fixed-wing aircraft performance simulations in Python

This repository contains a collection of fixed-wing aircraft performance simulations including the supporting python scripts. The simulations cover various aspects of flight performance, including takeoff, landing, climb, descent, cruise, and turns.

## Project Portfolio: 

### 1. Climb and Descent Performance Simulation
This simulation calculates the climb and descent performance of a typical large commercial transport aircraft.
